## About PI:
<br>

Dr. Li obtained B.S. in biological sciences from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Ph.D. in molecular genetics and genomics from Washington University in St. Louis. His research explores mechanisms of kidney injury, fibrosis and metabolic dysregulation with single-cell and spatial genomics approaches, including single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility and spatially resolved multiomics. In addition, he is broadly interested in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in human diseases, as well as development of cutting-edge genomics technologies.<br>

Since 2020, he has published 9 first-author research articles in journals such as Cell Metabolism, Nature Protocols, Scientific Data and Phenomics, and 6 first-author reviews in Nature Immunology, The Journal of Clinical Investigation and Kidney International. In Cell Metabolism 2022, Li et al. identified novel cell states of injured proximal tubules and dysregulated lipid metabolism in mouse models of kidney fibrosis, featured in the 2023 NIDDK annual report. In Cell Metabolism 2024, Li et al. developed a single-cell multiomics atlas for human kidneys, uncovering region-specific signatures. His work advances understanding of kidney injury and repair mechanisms and development of high-throughput genomics methods. Since 2023, he has been frequently invited as a peer reviewer by journals including Nature Communications, Kidney International, JASN and Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics.
