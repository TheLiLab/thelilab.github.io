I am an evolutionary geneticist with a wide variety of interests both in the lab and the rest of the world.

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-flask about-icon"></span>
I am an associate professor in the Department of Biology <a href= "https://www.biology.mcmaster.ca/ "> at McMaster University </a> Where our lab uses a variety of systems to address questions about how genetic and developmental mechanisms influence evolutionary processes, and how evolutionary history has shaped genetic and developmental mechanisms.
